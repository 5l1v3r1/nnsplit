__This project is a work in progress, I do not recommend using it yet.__

Fast, robust sentence splitting with bindings for Python, Rust and Javascript and pretrained models for English and German.

### Features

- __Robust__: Does not depend on proper punctuation and casing to split text into sentences.
- __Fast__: Can run on your GPU to split one million paragraphs from wikipedia in __TODO__ seconds (on an RTX 2080 TI).
- __Portable__: Models are trained in Python, but inference can be done from Javascript, Rust and Python.
- __Small__: NNSplit uses a character-level LSTM, so weights are very small (~ __TODO__ kB) which makes it easy to run in the browser.

## Usage

### Python

#### Installation

NNSplit has PyTorch as the only dependency.

Install it with pip: `pip install nnsplit`

#### Usage

```python
>>> from nnsplit import NNSplit
>>> splitter = NNSplit("de")
# NNSplit does not depend on proper punctuation and casing to split sentences
>>> splitter.split(["Das ist ein Test Das ist noch ein Test."])
[[[Token(text='Das', whitespace=' '),
   Token(text='ist', whitespace=' '),
   Token(text='ein', whitespace=' '),
   Token(text='Test', whitespace=' ')],
  [Token(text='Das', whitespace=' '),
   Token(text='ist', whitespace=' '),
   Token(text='noch', whitespace=' '),
   Token(text='ein', whitespace=' '),
   Token(text='Test', whitespace=''),
   Token(text='.', whitespace='')]]]
```

See the [Python README](./python_lib/README.md) for more information.

### Javascript

#### Installation

The Javascript bindings for NNSplit have TensorFlow.js as the only dependency.

Install them with npm: `npm install nnsplit`

#### Usage


```javascript
>>> const NNSplit = require("nnsplit");
// pass URL to the model.json, see https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/conversion/import_keras#step_2_load_the_model_into_tensorflowjs for details
>>> const splitter = NNSplit("path/to/model.json");
>>> await splitter.split(["Das ist ein Test Das ist noch ein Test."]);
__TODO__
```

Note: when running NNSplit from Node.js, you'll have to manually import `@tensorflow/tfjs-node` before instantiating `NNSplit`.

```javascript
require("@tensorflow/tfjs-node");
const NNSplit = require("nnsplit");
```

See the [Javascript README](./js_lib/README.md) for more information.

### Rust

#### Installation

Add NNSplit as a dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
...
nnsplit = "<version>"
...
```

#### Usage

```rust
use nnsplit::NNSplit;

fn main() -> failure::Fallible<()> {
    let splitter = NNSplit::new("de")?;

    let input = vec!["Das ist ein Test. Das ist noch ein Test."];
    println!("{:#?}", splitter.split(input));

    Ok(())
}
```

Models for German (`NNSplit::new("de")`) and English (`NNSplit::new("en")`) come prepackaged with NNSplit. Alternatively, you can also load your own model with `NNSplit::from_model(model: tch::CModule)`.

See the [Rust README](./rust_lib/README.md) for more information.

## Why?

I developed NNSplit for a side project where I am working on Neural Text Correction. In Neural Text Correction, it makes the most sense to me to have sentence-level input, rather than entire paragraphs.
In general, NNSplit might be useful for:
- NLP projects where sentence-level input is needed.
- For feature engineering (# of sentences, how sentences start, etc.)
- As inspiration for neural networks that work everywhere. NNSplit has bindings for Python, Rust and Javascript. But the code is really simple, so it is easy to use it as a template for other projects.

## How it works

NNSplit uses wikipedia dumps in the [Linguatools format](https://linguatools.org/tools/corpora/wikipedia-monolingual-corpora/) to train.
1. ) Paragraphs are extracted from the dump.
2. ) Split the paragraphs into tokens and sentences using a very accurate existing rule based sentencizer and tokenizer: [SoMaJo](https://github.com/tsproisl/SoMaJo).
3. ) With some probability, words at the start of a sentence are converted from uppercase to lowercase, and dots at the end of a sentence are removed. __This is the step that allows NNSplit to be more tolerant to errors than SoMaJo. For a rule-based system, it is nearly impossible to split sentences that don't have proper separation in the form of punctuation and casing. NNSplit solves this problem__.
4. ) Multiple "cuts" with a fixed length (default 100 characters) are extracted from a paragraph. This makes NNSplit invariant to input length. 
5. ) A simple sequence labeling RNN is trained to predict the two labels for each character. Because the NN works on character-level, embedding sizes are very small.
6. ) At inference time, the input text is split into multiple cuts with the same length of 100 characters so that the entire text is covered. NNSplit predicts each cut separately. The predictions are then averaged together for the final result.
